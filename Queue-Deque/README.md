As you can see, **you must use a doubly-linked list** to implement the Deque and **all operations must run in O(1).** A base code for the project is given. 
- You are asked to fill-in the Deque class methods defined in Deque.cpp. You should submit just this file, Deque.cpp. 
- You are NOT allowed to change the Deque class declaration given in Deque.h. Main.cpp contains two tests to test your Deque. 
- You are encouraged to implement your own test code. We will add other tests when grading your submissions.
